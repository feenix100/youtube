# Image to 3D Particle Visualization

## Overview

I created a one html file version that essentially does the same thing as the full stack project using vite that I built using replit.com


This is a full-stack web application built with React and Express that features an interactive 3D particle visualization system. The application allows users to upload images and convert them into animated particle systems using Three.js and WebGL shaders. The frontend provides real-time controls for visual effects like bloom and brightness, while the backend serves as a REST API foundation with PostgreSQL database integration.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript as the core framework
- **Three.js ecosystem** for 3D rendering:
  - `@react-three/fiber` for React integration
  - `@react-three/drei` for useful abstractions
  - `@react-three/postprocessing` for visual effects
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** with **Radix UI** components for styling
- **TanStack Query** for API state management
- **Zustand** for client-side state management (game state and audio)

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **Drizzle ORM** for database operations with PostgreSQL dialect
- Modular route structure with separation of concerns
- In-memory storage implementation with interface for easy database migration
- Custom middleware for request logging and error handling

### Database Design
- **PostgreSQL** database configured through Drizzle
- **Neon Database** integration for serverless PostgreSQL
- Schema-first approach with type-safe database operations
- User management system with username/password authentication structure

### 3D Visualization System
- **Custom shader system** for particle rendering with vertex and fragment shaders
- **Image processing pipeline** that converts uploaded images to particle data
- **Real-time animation** with time-based transformations
- **Post-processing effects** including bloom and brightness controls
- **Performance optimization** through reduced image resolution and efficient particle rendering

### State Management
- **Game state management** using Zustand with phase tracking (ready/playing/ended)
- **Audio state management** with mute/unmute functionality
- **UI state** managed through React component state and custom hooks
- **Mobile-responsive** design with touch interaction support

### File Organization
- **Monorepo structure** with clear separation between client, server, and shared code
- **Shared schema** definitions for type consistency across frontend and backend
- **Modular component architecture** with reusable UI components
- **Custom hooks** for cross-cutting concerns like mobile detection
