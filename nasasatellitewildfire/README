Download wildfire satellite data from a NASA API using a free API key, then create an Excel file, a PowerPoint presentation, a csv file, and a graph—all with a single Python script. 

Let me know how you would present this data in the comments below!

Big shoutout to NASA for making incredible open data and services available to the public. We’ll focus on wildfire data accessible via NASA tools like FIRMS (near-real-time active fire/hotspot detections) and related open APIs.
