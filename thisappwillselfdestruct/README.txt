🧨 Build a Self-Destructing To-Do App (With Voice + Explosions) in 10 Minutes!

What if your notes didn’t just sit there—they self-destructed with voice warnings, beeping countdowns, and dramatic explosions? In this video, I’ll show you how to code a to-do list app where every task has a fuse. Once the timer hits zero, the note goes 💥 with confetti, smoke, and a voice that warns you:
“This message will self destruct in X seconds.”

This isn’t your average productivity app—it’s a fun, creative build you can follow along with in just ~10 minutes. Perfect for coding practice, JavaScript experiments, or just pranking yourself.
